Swank Crew
==========

Swank Crew is a distributed computation framework written in Common Lisp that
uses Swank Client to evaluate forms on remote hosts.


The Swank Crew API
==================

connect-local-workers           Create a worker pool containing a set of worker
                                Lisps running on localhost.
connect-workers                 Create a worker pool containing a set of worker
                                Lisps running on remote hosts.
disconnect-workers              Disconnect all the workers in a worker pool.
eval-form-all-workers           Evaluate a form on all the workers in a worker pool.
eval-form-repeatedly            Evaluate a form repeatedly on the workers in a pool
                                and collect the results on the master.
eval-repeatedly-async-state     Evaluate a form repeatedly on the workers in a pool
                                while asynchronously updating the workers' state.
parallel-mapcar                 Use the workers in a worker pool to evaluate a
                                function on all the elements of a list.
parallel-reduce                 Use the workers in a worker pool to evaluate a
                                function on all the elements of a list.  As results
                                return to the master, call a function repeatedly to
                                reduce them to one value.

For more information, see the documentation strings for the above functions in
master.lisp and the example code in swank-crew_test.lisp.
