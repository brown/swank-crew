Swank Crew
==========

Swank Crew is a distributed computation framework written in Common Lisp that
uses Swank Client to evaluate forms on remote hosts.


The Swank Crew API
==================

connect-local-workers           Connect to a set of worker Lisps running on localhost.
connect-workers                 Connect to a set of worker Lisps running on remote hosts.
disconnect-workers              Disconnect all the workers in a worker pool.
eval-form-all-workers           Evaluate a form on all the workers in a worker pool.
eval-form-repeatedly            Evaluate a form repeatedly and collect the results.
eval-repeatedly-async-state     Evaluate a form repeatedly with async updates to worker state.
parallel-mapcar                 Evaluate a function on all elements of a list.
parallel-reduce                 Evaluate a function on all elements of a list and reduce the
                                results as they arrive on the master.

For more information, see the documentation strings for the above functions in
master.lisp and the example code in swank-crew_test.lisp.
